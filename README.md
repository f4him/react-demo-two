# React Learning basic projects

[Vercel Link](https://react-demo-two-nine.vercel.app) Images may take time to load. Also there's an error in console generated from a known bug in react-icons module.

This project is another of the basic projects I have done to learn react.

## Learning Outcomes
- Chakra UI
- some styling
